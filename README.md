# AnkiLangs

The aim of this project is collaborating in the creation of high quality, free
and open source Anki decks for language learning. Check the website for more
details [AnkiLangs.org](https://ankilangs.org).

AnkiLangs is not part of nor necessarily endorsed by Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

This is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) containing everything.


## Try it out

See [here](https://ankilangs.org/) for instructions and to download decks to
try yourself.


## Contribute changes

Edit the CSV files under `src/data/`. CSV files can be imported into Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice
Calc in order to edit them.

If you want to add or modify media files (e.g. audio) you must do so in the `src/media/` directory.

For example:
* The "Portuguese 625 words" deck contains a typo â†’ you should edit `src/data/625_words-base-pt_pt.csv`.
* A German audio recording for the word "Flugzeug" is incorrect â†’ you should replace the file `src/media/audio/de_DE/al_de_de_das_flugzeug.ogg`

If there are any large structural changes you want to make or anything else that involves a lot of
work on your side, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/ankilangs/ankilangs/issues/new/choose)
first in order to discuss it! Otherwise you risk investing much work only to get it rejected, which
is very frustrating.


### Send a pull request

In order for you modification to become part of the project you must send a PR (pull request) as documented
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

If you have no experience whatsoever with Git, GitHub, pull requests etc. then
you can send your edits to the CSV files via e-mail. For audio recordings we
can use a file sharing service. Please get in touch info@ankilangs.org .


## Build

If you want you can build the decks (i.e. convert the CSV files into Anki decks).
Note that you do not need to do this in order to make a contribution. If you want to improve a deck
you can stick to the "Contribute changes" section above and leave the complicated stuff to us ðŸ™‚.

To build the decks you need the following:

* Python 3 ([Installation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)).
* Poetry ([Installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)).
* Anki ([Installation](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download)).
* Within Anki the [CrowdAnki add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) (code 1788670778).
  [Add-on installation](https://docs.ankiweb.net/addons.html).

```bash
poetry install
poetry run brainbrew run recipes/source_to_anki_minimal_pairs.yaml
poetry run brainbrew run recipes/source_to_anki_625_words.yaml
```

Open Anki and via `File / CrowdAnki: Import from disk` import any of the `build/` subdirectories of this
Git repository.

Then you may review them like any deck.


### To create a new 625 words deck

* Copy and adapt one of the directories in `src/note_models/`

```bash
# Probably leave the following unchanged
export AL_SRC_NAME="en_to_pt"
export AL_SRC_NAME_2="EN to PT"
export AL_SRC_LANG_NAME="Portuguese"
export AL_SRC_LISTENING="Listening"
export AL_SRC_PRONUNCIATION="Pronunciation"
export AL_SRC_READING="Reading"
export AL_SRC_SPELLING="Spelling"

# CHANGE ME!
export AL_DST_NAME="de_to_fr"
export AL_DST_NAME_2="DE to FR"
export AL_DST_LANG_NAME="FranzÃ¶sisch"
export AL_DST_LISTENING="Listening"
export AL_DST_PRONUNCIATION="Pronunciation"
export AL_DST_READING="Reading"
export AL_DST_SPELLING="Spelling"
## Use the following if the source language is not EN
#export AL_DST_LISTENING="HÃ¶rverstÃ¤ndnis"
#export AL_DST_PRONUNCIATION="Aussprache"
#export AL_DST_READING="LeseverstÃ¤ndnis"
#export AL_DST_SPELLING="Rechtschreibung"


cp "src/headers/description_${AL_SRC_NAME}-625_words.html" \
  "src/headers/description_${AL_DST_NAME}-625_words.html"

cp -r "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_SRC_NAME}" \
  "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}"

sed -i "s/id: .*/id: `python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`/" \
  "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}/note.yaml"

find "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}/" -type f \
  -exec sed -i "s/${AL_SRC_NAME}/${AL_DST_NAME}/g" {} +

find "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}/" -type f \
  -exec sed -i "s/${AL_SRC_NAME_2}/${AL_DST_NAME_2}/g" {} +

find "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}/" -type f \
  -exec sed -i "s/${AL_SRC_LANG_NAME}/${AL_DST_LANG_NAME}/g" {} +

find "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}/" -type f \
  -exec sed -i "s/| ${AL_SRC_LISTENING}/| ${AL_DST_LISTENING}/g" {} +

find "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}/" -type f \
  -exec sed -i "s/| ${AL_SRC_PRONUNCIATION}/| ${AL_DST_PRONUNCIATION}/g" {} +

find "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}/" -type f \
  -exec sed -i "s/| ${AL_SRC_READING}/| ${AL_DST_READING}/g" {} +

find "src/note_models/vocabulary_${AL_DST_NAME}/" -type f \
  -exec sed -i "s/| ${AL_SRC_SPELLING}/| ${AL_DST_SPELLING}/g" {} +
```

Edit the deck description file:

```bash
vim "src/headers/description_${AL_DST_NAME}-625_words.html"
```

To generate new UUIDs you can use this command:

```bash
python3 -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"
```

Edit `recipes/source_to_anki_625_words.yaml`:
* Add the new source files under `generate_guids_in_csvs`
* Copy a block under `note_models_from_yaml_part` and:
  * Edit the `part_id` and `file`
* In the `headers_from_yaml_part` section copy a block and:
  * Edit the `part_id`
  * Edit the `name`
  * Replace `crowdanki_uuid` with a new UUID
  * Set the path of the `deck_description_html_file`
* In the `notes_from_csvs` section copy a block and:
  * Adapt all strings to the new language
* Copy a `generate_crowd_anki` section and replace all strings with the new
  language

Create the new CSV files you need under `src/data/` by copying and adapting
existing files. Note that the `guid` columns must stay empty since they have
to be unique and will automatically be generated during build.


### Generate Audio files

You need a Google Cloud account and need to be
[authenticated](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment).

Then execute, for example:

```bash
poetry run al-tools audio -i src/data/625_words-base-de_de.csv -o src/media/audio/de_DE/
```


## Release

To release a deck do the following:

* Update the version in the `src/headers/description*` file
* Build as described above
* Update the version in the `src/headers/description*` file to the next dev version
* Import the deck into Anki
* Export from Anki:
  * Include media
  * Support older Anki versions
* Rename the exported deck so it ends with the version e.g. `- 0.0.1`
* Add a new Git tag
* Create a release on GitHub with the exported deck
* Update the README and website with download links
