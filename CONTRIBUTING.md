Edit the CSV files under `src/data/`. CSV files can be imported into Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice
Calc in order to edit them.

If you want to add or modify media files (e.g. audio) you must do so in the `src/media/` directory.

For example:
* The "Portuguese 625 words" deck contains a typo → you should edit `src/data/625_words-base-pt_pt.csv`.
* A German audio recording for the word "Flugzeug" is incorrect → you should replace the file `src/media/audio/de_DE/al_de_de_das_flugzeug.ogg`

If there are any large structural changes you want to make or anything else that involves a lot of
work on your side, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/ankilangs/ankilangs/issues/new/choose)
first in order to discuss it! Otherwise you risk investing much work only to get it rejected, which
is very frustrating.
