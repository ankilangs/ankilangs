By practicing these pairs, you train your ear to distinguish similar sounds that may not exist in your native language.\nThis deck helps English speakers overcome common pronunciation and listening challenges in German by focusing on sounds that are easily confused.\nScreenshots# (Screenshots will be added here)\nChangelog# 0.2.1 - 2025-01-22# Initial public release 0.0.2 - 2024# Early development version 0.0.1 - 2024# Initial version "},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/installation/","title":"Installation","section":"Docs","content":"Installation# Installing a Deck# Download the .apkg file from the deck\u0026rsquo;s page Open Anki Go to File → Import Select the downloaded .apkg file Click \u0026ldquo;Import\u0026rdquo; The deck will be added to your collection and you can start studying immediately.\nUpdating a Deck# When a new version is released:\nDownload the new .apkg file Import it into Anki (same steps as above) Anki will update your deck while preserving your learning progress Your review history and card scheduling will be maintained during updates.\nInstalling Anki# If you don\u0026rsquo;t have Anki yet, check the official instructions for installing on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, or iOS.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/learning-tips/","title":"Learning Tips","section":"Docs","content":"Learning Tips# Study Tips# Study consistently: Daily practice is more effective than long, infrequent sessions Speak out loud: For pronunciation cards, always speak the answer aloud Use the audio: Listen carefully to native pronunciation on all audio-enabled cards Don\u0026rsquo;t rush: Take time to recall the answer before revealing it Be honest: Mark cards as \u0026ldquo;Again\u0026rdquo; if you couldn\u0026rsquo;t recall the answer quickly Adjusting Deck Options# Avoid learning too many new cards per day because it might quickly become overwhelming. The default value of New cards/day of 20 is a good start.\nWe strongly encourage you activate burying to make your learning most efficient. Otherwise you may for example be asked to do Reading for a word that you just completed Pronunciation for, which makes it too easy. This would hurt your long term progress since a few weeks later you no longer have the Pronunciation context and will fail. Also in real-life situations when you need to read a word you lack that context.\nEnabling FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) is also a good idea because it calculates more optimal review intervals.\nSee Anki\u0026rsquo;s documentation for detailed settings guidance.\nCard Types# Most AnkiLangs decks use four complementary card types to help you master vocabulary:\nPronunciation# See the source language word and speak the target language word aloud. Focus on accurate pronunciation.\nListening# Hear the target language word and recall its meaning in the source language. Trains your listening comprehension.\nReading# See the target language word and recall its meaning in the source language. Trains your reading comprehension.\nSpelling# See the source language word, hear the target language pronunciation, and type the target language word. Reinforces spelling and combines reading with listening.\nMinimal Pairs Decks# For minimal pairs decks specifically:\nListen carefully: Focus on the subtle differences between the sounds Repeat out loud: After revealing the answer, practice speaking both words Use the audio repeatedly: Play each audio multiple times if needed Practice regularly: Daily short sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones "}]
