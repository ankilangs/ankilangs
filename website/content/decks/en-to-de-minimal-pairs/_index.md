## What are Minimal Pairs?

Minimal pairs are pairs of words that differ in only one phoneme (sound), such as "Beet" (flowerbed) vs "Bett" (bed) in German. By practicing these pairs, you train your ear to distinguish similar sounds that may not exist in your native language.

This deck helps English speakers overcome common pronunciation and listening challenges in German by focusing on sounds that are easily confused.
