# Roadmap

A rough sketch where this _could_ be going.

* Allow learning from many language to many other languages (e.g. enable a native French speaker to learn Swahili)
* Create minimal pair decks to learn pronunciation
* Create language specific IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) decks for learning what the IPA symbols mean and what sounds they encode to enable learners to efficiently use a dictionary
* Create decks for learning the 625 basic words in any language
* Create cards for learning vocabulary and grammatical structures according to levels (e.g. A1, A2, B1, ...)
* Create advanced monolingual decks e.g. for learning what _pecuniary_ or _peevish_ mean in English
