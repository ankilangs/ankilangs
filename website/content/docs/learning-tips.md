# Learning Tips

## Card Types

Most AnkiLangs decks use four complementary card types to help you master vocabulary:

### Pronunciation
See the source language word and speak the target language word aloud. Focus on accurate pronunciation.

### Listening
Hear the target language word and recall its meaning in the source language. Trains your listening comprehension.

### Reading
See the target language word and recall its meaning in the source language. Trains your reading comprehension.

### Spelling
See the source language word, hear the target language pronunciation, and type the target language word. Reinforces spelling and combines reading with listening.

## Study Tips

- **Study consistently**: Daily practice is more effective than long, infrequent sessions
- **Speak out loud**: For pronunciation cards, always speak the answer aloud
- **Use the audio**: Listen carefully to native pronunciation on all audio-enabled cards
- **Don't rush**: Take time to recall the answer before revealing it
- **Be honest**: Mark cards as "Again" if you couldn't recall the answer quickly
- **Context matters**: Once you've learned a word, try to use it in sentences

## Adjusting Anki Settings

You can customize Anki's spaced repetition algorithm to match your learning style:

- **New cards per day**: Start with 10-20, adjust based on your available time
- **Maximum reviews per day**: Ensure you have enough time to complete your reviews
- **Lapses**: Consider using a shorter interval for forgotten cards

See [Anki's documentation](https://docs.ankiweb.net/) for detailed settings guidance.

## Minimal Pairs Decks

For minimal pairs decks specifically:

- **Listen carefully**: Focus on the subtle differences between the sounds
- **Repeat out loud**: After revealing the answer, practice speaking both words
- **Use the audio repeatedly**: Play each audio multiple times if needed
- **Practice regularly**: Daily short sessions are more effective than long, infrequent ones
