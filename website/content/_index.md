# Welcome to AnkiLangs!

The aim of this project is collaborating in the creation of high quality, free
and open source [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) decks for language learning.

Anki is open source spaced repetition software meant for creating and
memorizing _flashcards_.

This project is not affiliated in any way with Anki nor is it necessarily
endorsed by the Anki team. We do not mean to imply that any language learning
deck must come from this project.


## Try it out

Download decks from ankiweb.net

* [AnkiLangs | EN to DE | 625 Words (Beta)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2024801126) to learn German.
* [AnkiLangs | EN to PT | 625 Words (Beta)](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1172900677) to learn Portuguese.


## Motivation

* Many languages decks are unstructured, incomplete or even contain errors
* Collaboration (sending in corrections) is frequently not possible or
  cumbersome (via e-mail)
* The origin of the content is frequently unclear and may violate copyright
  laws, making it unsuitable for investing more work.


## Goals

* Prioritize quality over quantity. Incorrect information or errors are a
  no-go.
* Encourage and simplify collaboration to involve many people around the world
  to create and continously improve these decks
* Create content with permissive open source licenses for easy use and re-use.
