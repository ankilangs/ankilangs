# Welcome to AnkiLangs!

The aim of this project is collaborating in the creation of high quality, free
and open source [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) decks for language learning.

Anki is open source spaced repetition software meant for creating and
memorizing _flashcards_.

This project is not affiliated in any way with Anki nor is it necessarily
endorsed by the Anki team.

## Try it out

Download one of the [decks](docs/decks) and follow the
[installation instructions](docs/installation).

Some examples:

* If you speak **English** and want to learn [Spanish | 625 Words](docs/decks/en-to-es-625/)
* Wenn du **Deutsch** sprichst und [Französisch | 625 Wörter](docs/decks/de-to-fr-625/) lernen möchtest.
* Si hablas **español** y quieres aprender [Inglés | 625 palabras](docs/decks/es-to-en-625/)
* ... and **many more** ...

See the the full list of [available decks](docs/decks).


## Motivation

* Many languages decks are unstructured, incomplete or even contain errors
* Collaboration (sending in corrections) is frequently not possible or
  cumbersome (via e-mail)
* The origin of the content is frequently unclear and may violate copyright
  laws, making it unsuitable for investing more work.


## Goals

* Prioritize quality over quantity. Incorrect information or errors are a
  no-go.
* Encourage and simplify collaboration to involve many people around the world
  to create and continously improve these decks
* Create content with permissive open source licenses for easy use and re-use.
